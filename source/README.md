## How to get your location file

You can get you data from [here](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout)

 - Click "Select None", scroll down and find "Location History"
 - Switch that on and make sure it says "JSON format" next to it
 - Scroll to the bottom and click next
 - You dont need to change any options on the next page
 - Click "create archive"
 - Wait for a minute, depending on the size of the data you may want to leave it working and continue when it is done
 - Download the zip file and find your "location history.json" in `Takeout/Location History`
